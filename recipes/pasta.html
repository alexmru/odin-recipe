        can do. Still, there are a few simple tricks to master so your pasta turns out just right. We'll show you how to
        cook pasta, including how long to cook pasta, and answer some frequently asked questions about how to cook pasta
        noodles. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked pasta</li>
        <li>A large (6- to 8-quart) pot</li>
        <li>Four to six quarts of cold water</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons of salt</li>
        <li>A long-handled heat-proof spoon</li>
        <li>A colander for draining the pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Before adding the pasta, add salt to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Stir gently. Short pasta should be stirred immediately after adding it to water, but let spaghetti and long
            strands soften for a minute before stirring. Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta cooks. </li>
        <li>Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite. </li>
        <li>Drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>Serve pasta immediately. We highly recommend using warm bowls!</li>
    </ol>
